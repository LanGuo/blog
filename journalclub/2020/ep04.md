# Journal Club, episode 4

Lan presents a blog post from Google Deepmind about [Dopamine and temporal difference learning](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Dopamine-and-temporal-difference-learning-A-fruitful-relationship-between-neuroscience-and-AI). This is the story of a fruitful collaboration between Neuroscience and AI researchers that found the activity of dopamine neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area during a learnt probablistic reward task was consistent with distributional temporal-difference reinforcement learning. That's a mouthful, go read it yourself! 

Kyle: Hey Alexa! Sorry I fooled you ...

George talks about his first attempts at designing an [Auto-Trading Agent with Deep Q Networks](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/journalclub/2020/trading-agents-dqn) and how he was outsmarted by a group of 20 neurons.
