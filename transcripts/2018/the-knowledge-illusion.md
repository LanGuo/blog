<p>episode 230 welcome to data skeptic podcast about data science and fake news from an algorithm here's your house I'll fold it coming to you from an undisclosed location in the Los Angeles area welcome to the podcast famous for resolving goldbach's conjecture this is David skeptic and you're listening to our ongoing series on fake news today I'll be interviewing Steven sloman a professor of cognitive linguistic and psychological Sciences at Brown University and the current editor-in-chief of the journal cognition he's the author of several books including my favorite the knowledge illusion why we never think alone this was one of the books that really got me thinking about fake news so I was glad to have the opportunity to speak with Steven on his research people Define fake news in very different ways and so I think it's important not to get too caught up in the definition there's a sense in which fake news is like pornography that is you know it when you see it I'm not one who believes that we have direct access to reality and some things are true and other things are clearly false nevertheless there are certain things were told that are grounded in empirical reality and there are other things in which people are trying to intentionally deceive us about and I think fake news refers to the ladder kind of thing do you think this is a new phone obviously it's in the public Consciousness but is something fundamentally different today than it was maybe 20 years ago well something is fundamentally different but no it's not a new phenomenon in fact I think it's hundreds if not thousands of years old people have been trying to deceive one another by telling them stories about the horrible things the enemy has done for instance since time immemorial and in fact Walter Lippmann wrote a book in 1922 describing propaganda in World War that was clearly descriptions of events that did not occur and descriptions of people who are nothing like those descriptions and moreover you know there's a history free of stereotypes and caricatures of all kinds of people that go back hundreds of years fake news is part and parcel of how societies of operated since time immemorial clearly technology has changed the nature of the game in more than one way so on one hand it's provided us Untold more amounts of information but I thought we just now have access to all kinds of information that we didn't have access to before that information can correspond to reality so we more of that and information sometimes doesn't correspond to reality and we have more of that too so there's a much bigger problem in sorting through all of the data that we now have on our eyeballs at our fingertips so I have a little bit of a bias I guess I feel like I can tell fake news when I see it and then I'm not going to fall for it and maybe that's a dangerous point of you to have find that people generally think that way or are people aware that there in the world that's actively working on deceiving them. I definitely think that the cognitive system is such that when we encounter information we naturally perceive it to be factual Dan Gilbert's the social psychologist in Harvard who started the whole literature on this topic distinguished what he called the Cartesian view of Truth with the Spinoza view of Truth where they card said we Encounter of fact that we decide whether it's true or false if it's true we accept it if it's false we were ejected where Spinoza said we Encounter of fact we automatically entered into our database of knowledge and then we might maybe under the right circumstances decide that it's false and throw it out and what Gilbert's data suggest is that people are much more spinosum than they are season that the act of rejecting stuff is not automatic but takes a real effort so in that sense we all think that the information we encounter is reality in the same sense that we think that the stories we hear our sort of direct reflections of actual events in the world though I suspect it's also the case that if you ask people What proportion of the news that you are told by the media is true they would tend to give low estimates right I mean the psychology of what people except in the media and don't accept is rather complicated and Depends a lot on our idiot logical commitments in my mind there's sort of a gradient you know at one extreme there are academic Publications in pure review journals with high impact factors and that it's not ground truth but it's about as close as we can get to the other end which is maybe the rags you pick up in a grocery store I'm always trying to assess we are bit of information Falls along that Spectrum am I somewhat unique in that way or do other people have these abilities to kind of place context around news when they receive it I wouldn't say you're unique but I would say you're a member of a rare breed and of course I don't know you Kyle like we never met before it so I would really want to text you and find out whether you're really is critical as you think you are I'm sure you are since I was good at it but yeah I don't think most people do in Psychology there's this test called the cognitive reflection test developed by a guy named Shane Frederick's is now at Yale it's really very simple questions all of which of the following structure there's a clear intuitive answer that pops to mind but it's an answer that's wrong and it's find the right answer but it does take a small amount of cognitive work this so I'll give you an example this isn't one of the questions but it gives you a flavor of them how many animals of each kind did Moses load on the ark well I'm inclined to say to but I feel like there's a trappy except for me hear well in fact Moses didn't load any animals on the ark right it was Noah that loaded animals on the Earth so there wasn't trapped and the point of the example is that they're this simple answer to Pops to mind but it doesn't take much thought right discover that yes there's a trap and to come up with the right answer and that's the nature of these simple questions on the cognitive reflection test so there's an intuitive answer that you have to inhibit in order to think of little bit more to come up with the correct answer so people who get these questions right we can cover people who don't get them right we can call intuitive or non-reflective and it turns out the vast majority of the population is non-reflective in about 70% of Americans are non-reflective and 4 / 60% of MIT students or non-reflective their non-reflective people everywhere and every discipline in every area of life and what the date of show is that non-reflective people are much less likely to deliberate about what they encounter and so they're much less likely to evaluate fake news and decide whether it's true and false they're much more likely to just accept it and go on with their day which is not unreasonable in a way right I mean the vast majority of information you encounter in the day you just accept and go on with you don't question everything yes you should be critical of news but that requires tires pudding news into a special category it requires a real thoughtful act in order to be critical and even with news he can't do it all the time it would just take too much is it from the statistics you gave if we consider non-reflective people to be sort of an ailment then it's rather prolific and culture is that something you think we should be working on better educating people trying to develop the skills or do we just need to have a society that works within the constructive knowing people are like this I would say mostly the latter I do not want to say non reflectivity is an ailment any trait that 70% of people have I would not want to call an ailment you know there's there's a reason that we're not reflect about everything it takes time to be reflective it takes resources to be reflective in it inhibits other kinds of processes that we might want to engage you write it might make us less creative to be reflective we have two trade-offs deliberating and being critical of everything with all of our other goals in life so of course we want to teach people critical reasoning strategies in the sense that when there's an opportune time to be reflective or to be critical people should know what to do I got to tell you though it feels to me like that that's not really critical problem with fake news now if I come across some except I'm standing in line in the grocery store then that's one thing but if I'm sitting at my computer and come across some wild claim I don't generally find it really hard to discover whether it's true or false I mean their websites you can go to something just Google it and see whether credible organizations are reporting it as well as skills are important I actually think there are two other things with your more important one is just making people aware that critical reasoning requires effort it's something you do have to think about it something that you do have to learn to do because there are biases built into the cognitive system but I think even more important than that we think we don't want to just focus on individuals we have to focus on the culture individuals fundamentally don't think alone but we're constantly dependent on others for information for all kinds of cognitive processing for remembering things for doing calculations there's a sense in which whenever we do anything we do it as a community and so if we're going to be critical I'm weak since we can't be critical all the time we have to be reminded by others went to be critical what we really need more and anything is a culture in which it's okay to say to someone is that true where did you learn that is that credible is that plausible here's a reason why that might be right there are communities already in which I think that is the norm effect of scientific lab meetings are like that people are constantly being challenged people make claims and other people scratch their heads that are skeptical of any sort of philosophical debate is also like that it's okay to be skeptical so I I feel like that is the closest thing we can come to a a silver bullet to solve this problem of fake news to induce to allow a culture which allows skepticism I guess you know that already given the name of your organization is well yeah so we're touching on a lot of the topics mentioned in your book the knowledge illusion I will check is a great read I definitely recommend to listen to check out could you tell me a little bit about the book and what you cover in it the book is a two-fold argument where we point out that as individuals were relatively ignorant and that we don't understand fully how ignorant we are that we think we understand how things work better than we actually do so that's the one theme of the book the second theme is an attempt to explain given that individuals are ignorant how is it that humanity is able to accomplish so much we operate within a community of knowledge there's a division of cognitive labor such that whenever we do anything we do things as a group we cover a lot of data from cognitive science and other areas and a big part of the book is drying out invitations of this view for politics for education for a relationship with technology for Asian making and for one or two other things that are slipping my mind at the moment so I think that case very strongly and I didn't find a point that I thought was particularly controversial in that regard that you know people are in certain ways ignorant in it we get past that with communities of knowledge is there is this a radical new idea in your field or is it the kind of something to a researchers have been migrating towards for a while it's certainly not a radical new idea Walter Lippmann again had that similar ideas back in 1922 and then I'm sure when could find precursors of the ideas even before that on there certainly precursors of the idea in Psychology cognitive science and then philosophy I actually think the importance of the idea is not so much that it's entirely novel but that it's not consistent with the way first cognitive science thinks about the mind but seconds how everyday people think about the mind in cognitive science there's a tendency to build models of mental processing the mental functioning which are descriptions of what's going on inside the skull and in fact a lot of people now or doing this at the neuro level that is their building models of how the brain works and those models are in some sense replacing a lot of the fear Rising that's going on in cognitive science of everything being inside the skull I find deeply wrong have it if we really want to understand how human beings process information we have to think about things that are much higher level we have to think about interactions between people it's not revolutionary in cognitive science but it's something that diverges from the main street view in cognitive science and in fact mainstreamed action that cognitive science is moving so human beings are always looking from the inside out we see the environment around us we see the world that were living in when we see how it impinges on us as individuals we see what we bring to the table and it always seems different than what others are bringing to the table and so it's very natural for individual human beings to think about their own mental processes as things that are going on inside their brain in fact we are doing the book it turns out that much of many of the conclusions we come to the inferences we make the decisions we make the actions we take our function not only a brain processes but of all kinds of other stuff going on in our bodies in the world and in other people's minds we Outsource a lot of the information processing we need to do you know we want to know whether a policy is good or bad we don't just think it through but we see what the people we respect and in fact that's the right thing to do I happen to be a great believer in climate change but it's not because I can give you a super fisticated analysis of how and why the Earth is warming and what the consequences of that are I mean that's just not the kind of scientist I am I rely on the knowledge to other scientists have and I Incorporated I'm not fully aware of the degree to which I incorporate other people's thinking and other people's beliefs into my own when you put it that way it seems like a strength of our culture in a way to me I mean if you asked me how does a computer work something I have some expertise in I can tell you a great deal of information but you know it some level I don't know how the transistor is actually manufactured but I know someone else out there knows it takes care of that for me so in that regard is this way that we share Collective knowledge measure it to ascribe any sort of properties to it that we want to study in it how may be scientifically we're a culture is even if its individual people aren't up to speed on the latest and greatest that's an interesting question we are studying it and in many ways the way my lab is focusing on on the issue is by trying to figure out the ways in which people Outsource problems without being aware that they're Outsourcing those problems I have a grad student the buck animation who has shown that we often you single words a satisfying satisfactory explanations for things right so I'll give you an example that's not from his studies but it'll you a sense of what he's doing so someone might say why is this food healthy and someone else might answer because it's organic well I would argue that organic actually doesn't carry a lot of information it's made of carbon okay so it tells you that but that that's a fact that you probably already do I said it was made of carbon in your people use organic to me multiple different figs I spent I lived in California for a while and they're sort of five different levels of Oregon this city in Berkeley right now which Supermarket you go to people mean very different things by it and yet if you say it it turns out people think that's a satisfactory explanation in general service satisfactory explanations if those words are entrenched in a community and not if those words are not entrenched in a community so what the buckets shown is he comes up with situations where the words literally has zero informational value informational content that carry zero bits of information but if the community uses the word people will say it's a satisfactory explanation and if someone just has come up with the word on their own then it's not a satisfactory explanation so that's one example of how we Outsource judgments that we have to make to other people without really being aware that we're doing so I could go on with examples if you want me to share absolutely so another one is work that my colleague Eleanor amita's done in which she shows that you describe an act by someone like the CEO is selling some drug and the drug either has a seriously harmful effect or it has a not such a bad effect still bad but not so bad moreover we tell people either selling the drug is legal or selling the drug is illegal and then we say how bad is this act on a scale from 1 to 7 how morally acceptable is what the CEO did people don't care at all about the impact of the truck that is the impact of the drug has zero influence on people's judgments of moral acceptability what matters to people is whether the Act was legal or illegal data are really quite powerful you know it's important to understand that they only see one impact or the other and they only learned whether it is legal or illegal they don't get a variety they're not comparing one situation to another or explanation for this is that a peep people appeal to legality because it allows them to Outsource this very difficult question of how moral the action is instead of answering the question how moral is this action they're able to answer a much simpler question how legal is this app so what they're doing is outsourcing the question of morality to the people who make the law so that's at least our hypothesis that's another example example and this is more of a sort of hypothetical example of how we Outsource you can imagine a society in which I believe I understand the effect of say some medical insurance policy because the people around me think they understand the effect of the medical insurance policy as Moses then exactly and we actually have some direct data that learning that other people understand does increase your own sense of understanding so if I think I understand because the people around me think they understand and the people around me think they understand because the people them think they understand right and everybody has the sense of understanding only because they're surrounded by other people who have a sense of understanding then you can have an entire Community with this deep sense of understanding even though nobody understands so that's one consequence of Outsourcing and not knowing that you're Outsourcing being non-reflective about Outsourcing and to be honest that is probably the most important role that fake news place in our society I don't think it's the information content per say it's more the you have other people who are telling you look at these evil people look what they do right look at this conspiracy that's going on I hate them and now everyone who sees this piece of news is going to be more likely to hate them and we have reason because we understand because here's some information for the person who's taking the fake news doesn't necessarily fully comprehend even accept what they're seeing but they nevertheless are left with this sense of affiliation with the people who who delivered it to them because they know they other people are seeing it to there's a sense of community affiliation which of course is to be contrasted with the target group in the fake news which you know inevitably you build up resenting so it's just a way of polarizing people by making them feel closer to one community and more distant from another community and indeed polarisation is has increased by Leaps and Bounds in the last several years my name is Gina not saying her story college at Boeing turn on to experience a different company is a collection of campuses where people can access the skills Network stay meet in person to level up in data science years I was pregnant at the time so starting a multi-year master's program wasn't really realistic and so I like the idea of being able to go all in full time intensive education for 3 months and be able to come out the other side with a new skill set galvanized and just focus on the academics part of it understanding how to develop some really cool models from the very beginning how to get a business number standing person that you're developing a model for good used in developing a Capstone project Gene is involved the novel use of recommender systems getting to work with a real company which is great but we ended up doing was using a recommender system of fiber to filtering model to recommend top races but since directions to the runners but actually providing some business insights to the owner I took that then a step further and we looked at which races were most often recommended when we first looked at recommender systems I thought was cool but I don't think I would want Focus but some projects that you can apply a lot of these models in ways that are a little different than you might initially think being able to think outside the box and apply them in different ways and something that really stood out to me learn more as galvanized. Comm data skeptic that's galvanized. Com data skeptic well if we were to take this idea of you to my confidence that I know something based on if I think people around me know it I could describe it as a strategy right right you know in one since I could go independently learn everything which would never I never complete my task or I could trust that you know my neighbors seem to do an activity doesn't seem too bad for them I'll just take for granted that maybe someone out there and double-check things they've arrived at the truth and I can follow their lead is there a issue with that strategy overall the alternative being but like you were saying I have to go and learn everything myself we settled to this because it's sort of a game theoretically nice place to be it is that why I societies behave this one oh I thought I'd say it more strongly than that we've settled on Evolution has settled on this strategy because it's the only option available to us the world's incredibly complex and you know it's not only the case that it would take our entire life time to learn everything we had to know to say make the best possible political decision it would take our entire lifetime to learn everything we have to know about any one issue in order to make a wise decision you know I don't even know if it's Evolution so much that has built-in this strategy as much as you know metaphysical reality like the world is just so complain that we can only be Specialists and some tiny narrow little sliver of of possibility and we depend on others we have to depend on others we have no choice but to depend on others so yet we have to use that strategy we have no choice but we can't be aware that were using so I do try to be reflective I mean I try to be reflective about where is this true or false I also try to be reflective about the source of my own beliefs so you know I suffer as much hate and resentment about certain politicians as anybody what does I'm constantly trying to tell myself that I'm being manipulated by my own Community because I think I am you know that's just how communities work and I think if we were all a little more accepting of that fact then perhaps conversation would be a little easier we be able to reach compromise a little more quickly because we'd be less confidence about our own accuracy of confidence there's an interesting approach you can take that I learned about in the book when I hear things about the way in which I like everyone else is ignorant in many ways it's kind of disheartening I have this goal of believing is many true things in this few false things as possible yet knowing that that sort of unattainable but one thing that really brought me some but I was happy to learn about it from the book was how you can get someone to see the light by asking them I guess it's pouring the illusion explanatory depth can you tell me a little bit about the mechanisms that you can take people through their so this is a psychological phenomenon first son covered by a couple of psychologist named Leon rosenblatt &amp; Frank Kyle and what they did was they took everyday common objects like zippers and ballpoint pens and toilets and they ask people how well they understood how they worked people you know thought they understood that I worked on a 7-point scale that gave numbers on average like 4 and 5 and then they said okay how do they work explain it in as much detail as you possibly can and people have them hard and struggled and found that they were not able to give a complete explanation or anything close to be back tonight so when Resolute and Kyle again ask them now how well do you understand how the thing works people lowered their judgments in other words people of themselves and me did that before hand they had been living in this illusion of understanding or the solution of explanatory depth is Rosa but I'll say. In fact their understanding is not what they thought it was so the process of explanation revealed to them that they don't understand so what I did with some of my colleagues is show the same thing in the political domain just prior to the 2012 election we gave people some policy issues things that were common discourse at the time like whether they should be a cap-and-trade policy and carbon emissions weather there should be unilateral sanctions on Iran right some things never changed and we ask people how well they understood the issues yes in to explain them and then we found that that lowered subsequent Judgment of understanding by having people explain or try to explain how these policies would lead to consequences we puncture their sense of understanding what we also showed is that punching their sense of understanding also puncture their confidence so people became less confident in their attitude regarding the policy after trying to explain how it worked but seems like a very powerful mechanism though then that maybe we could take advantage of it does and and I do think that we should take advantage of it you know there are X actually examples out there where we have taken advantage of it so along with a buck my grad student and some others when we look at people's attitudes toward same-sex marriage those have changed a lot over the past 10 years since Obama took office and what we did was we took over a bunch of comments on Reddit about same-sex marriage and we did this statistical analysis of them we applied what's all the topic model or an LDA analysis and we showed that over time people discuss the topic lesson terms of their sacred values and More in terms of consequences so the nature of the discourse about same-sex marriage has changed in parallel with changes in people's attitudes Minds change when the conversation changes from one about people's basic intrinsic sacred values to one about what the actual consequences of the policy would be if you're talking about what the Bible says about marriage or about how everyone has a fundamental right to choose who they love then you're not going to achieve much consensus you're not going to change it at least mine but if you're talking about whether having two fathers or two mothers has an effect on a child's welfare well that's something you can actually talk about and it turns turns out that you know which of those people are talking about is in a sense up to them that you can frame issues in different ways and how you frame them will matter so that's a positive side I've got to be honest that it's not clear to me that one can easily scale up the kind of experiment we ran to you know an entire nations discourse because when you ask somebody to explain something you kind of annoyed them people don't like being asked to explain things especially when they can't sure hate people don't like having their ignorance accept it and they'll realize they're ignorant but then they won't want to talk to you it's something that we should do and actually I act I think it's the media's responsibility more than any to change the discourse from one about well basically from what about who's going to win the next election which is 90% of what they talk about the one about what the actual consequences of things would be like how is our world working I find it very annoying when I encounter almost all news these days respectable Outlets even you know PBS and NPR This little discussion about the Gory details by which things change by which policies are going to have effects because it's hard to talk about that right it's not always Pleasant that sort of it's a little like going to engineering class instead we talk about our what we value and what are friends thinks and what the polls say you know who's going to win the next election again and again and again will Steven I know this may seem like it's a little bit of a left turn to close out our interview but this program which is now focusing on fake news has just come off of a long stretch of discussing artificial intelligence which in a way does come up in the book could you leave us with a teaser about your thoughts on how machines that make decisions fit into the way in which human beings share and in retain knowledge while it look at this it's very clear that the most important member of our community of knowledge these days is Google we want to learn something that's the primary place we go and in fact we all have dinner Partners who we wish you would stop going there the internet in that sense is critically important it has you know widens our community of knowledge to an incredible degree that's the good news the bad news is that technology is not a member of our community in the same sense that other human beings are members of Our Community Technology does not share our intentionality so human beings have this very special ability to share goals with others to focus attention on common goals and of ways of achieving those goals I'm so that were constantly collaborating together aren't human beings have this incredible ability to work together and there are psychologists who argue that there's no other species that comes close to human beings and the ability to do that what's clear is that technology is in another dimension technology is completely unable for the most part to share our intentionality you know engineer's are busy trying to get Google to understand what we mean when we type in a search query it takes a human being to really figure out what it is that another human being is trying to achieve and to step in and help them achieve that and that's the reason that technology has led people astray so often in the book we pepper variety of examples of how various Transportation tragedies are results of people misusing the technology or the technology misunderstanding what the humans was trying to do when we use AI we have to be super careful because we come more and more to depend on it even though it's lacking this really really important trait the ability to figure out what in the ends were trying to accomplish so I think that's an excellent challenge to developers of future AI systems you know perhaps there one day I'll be a system where I can give it my intentions of the types of articles that I want related to whatever my interests are and then it would automatically optimize to bring me as many true statements in a few false statements as possible but until we have such machines it seems we're going to continue living in a world where the internet brings us a mix of real and fake news is fake news is at least partially unavoidable what are the consequences for society we have a tendency to think that fake news. Just information and its changes people's beliefs right we see this information we update our beliefs in a way that corresponds to the fake news it's not at all obvious that that is the consequence the consequences maybe one that's more emotional or as I suggested earlier it may be more about the affiliate with who we love and who we hate and it may not really affect our beliefs at all one thing we do know is that we're much more likely to be critical of fake news that's inconsistent with our beliefs but that maybe more because the fake news is questioning our community is questioning our team our family those who we love and so we respond in the kind of emotional way these are all open questions and I hope we're able to answer them Sunday yeah me too and I look forward to watching your future work and this topic in general is there a Best place people can follow you online I might have a website the sloman lab website but it's full of academic papers I really do hope they go and read the book and read my next book when it comes out as well excellent well that's the knowledge illusion why we never think alone and be sure to give you a heads up when your Nextbook it's the stands thanks Kyle it's been a great pleasure thanks for listening to skeptic for the news may be fake but the data doesn't lie show your support by getting a t-shirt at data skeptic.
