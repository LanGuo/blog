## Cardiologist Level Arrhythmia Detection with CNNs

Our guest Pranav Rajpurkar and his coauthored recently published [Cardiologist-Level Arrhythmia Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01836.pdf), a paper in which they demonstrate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks which outperform board certified cardiologists in detecting a wide range of heart arrhythmias from ECG data.
