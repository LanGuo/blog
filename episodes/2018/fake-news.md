## Fake News

This episode kicks off our new theme of "Fake News" with guests [Robert Sheaffer](http://www.sheaffer.org/) and [Brad Schwartz](https://abradschwartz.com/).

Fake news is a new label for an old idea.  For our purposes, we will define fake news information created to deliberately mislead while masquerading as a legitimate, journalistic source of truth.  It's become a modern topic of discussion as our cultures evolve to the fledgling mechanisms of communication introduced by online platforms.

What was the earliest incident of fake news? That's a question for which we may never find a satisfying answer.  While not the earliest, we present a dramatization of an early example of fake news, which leads us into a discussion with UFO Skeptic Robert Sheaffer.  Following that we get into our main interview with Brad Schwartz, author of [Broadcast Hysteria: Orson Welles's War of the Worlds and the Art of Fake News](https://www.amazon.com/Broadcast-Hysteria-Orson-Welless-Worlds/dp/0809031647).
