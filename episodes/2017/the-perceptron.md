## The Perceptron

Today's episode overviews the perceptron algorithm.  This rather simple approach is characterized by a few particular features.  It updates it's weights after seeing every example, rather than as a batch.  It uses a step function as an activation function.  It's only appropriate for linearly separable data, and it will converge to a solution if the data meets this criteria.  Being a fairly simple algorithm, it can run very efficiently.  Although we don't discuss it in this episode, multi-layer perceptron networks are what makes this technique most attractive.
