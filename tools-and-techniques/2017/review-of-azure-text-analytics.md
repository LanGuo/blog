## Review of Azure Text Analytics

I believe we're going to see a continued trend towards commoditization of certain data science services.  The classic example is spam filtering, but even more potential could come out of areas like computer vision and text analytics.  The field and therefore the marketplace are evolving quickly, so every so often I like to run a few tests to see where certain services stand in their development.

In this short post, I demo a quick result of how Microsoft Cognitive Services Text Analytics API does key phrase extraction on some recent posts from the dataskeptic.com blog.  Details on this API can be found [here](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c6).

On the positive side, these key phrases are clearly the result of some entity extraction process.  The selected phrases are extracted from my text directly.  While the selections might be informed by some transfer learning after an algorithm was trained on some external corpus, the system behind this API is doing more than trying to shoehorn my text into it's pre-existing, inflexible taxonomy.  I like that the API is robust in this way.

On the negative side, these labels aren't directly useful for me.  These might be useful to a manual process where a human reviewer picks the most applicable terms.  In time, enough reviews of this sort might enable a simple classifier to be built to post-process this list.  Similarly, these labels might be useful for ensembling.  Perhaps these phrases as features might be useful in a model you're working on.  Yet, on their own, I wouldn't use these programmatically directly.

The rest of this post are the keywords for each of those blog posts so you can judge for yourself.
