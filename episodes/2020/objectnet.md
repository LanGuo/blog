## ObjectNet

[Andrei Barbu](https://twitter.com/_abarbu_) joins us to discuss [ObjectNet](https://objectnet.dev/) - a new kind of vision dataset.

In contrast to ImageNet, ObjectNet seeks to provide images that are more representative of the types of images an autonomous machine is likely to encounter in the real world.  Collecting a dataset in this way required careful use of Mechanical Turk to get Turkers to provide a corpus of images that removes some of the bias found in ImageNet.
