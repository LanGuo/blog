## Annotator Bias

The modern deep learning approaches to natural language processing are voracious in their demands for large corpora to train on.  Folk wisdom estimates used to be around 100k documents were required for effective training.  The availability of broadly trained, general-purpose models like BERT has made it possible to do transfer learning to achieve novel results on much smaller corpora.

Thanks to these advancements, an NLP researcher might get value out of fewer examples since they can use the transfer learning to get a head start and focus on learning the nuances of the language specifically relevant to the task at hand.  Thus, small specialized corpora are both useful and practical to create.

In this episode, Kyle speaks with [Mor Geva](https://mega002.github.io/), lead author on the recent paper [Are We Modeling the Task or the Annotator? An Investigation of Annotator Bias in Natural Language Understanding Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07898.pdf), which explores some unintended consequences of the typical procedure followed for generating corpora.
