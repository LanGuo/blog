## Text World and Word Embedding Lower Bounds

In the first half of this episode, Kyle speaks with Marc-Alexandre Côté and Wendy Tay about Text World.  Text World is an engine that simulates text adventure games.  Developers are encouraged to try out their reinforcement learning skills building agents that can programmatically interact with the generated text adventure games.

In the second half of this episode, Kyle interviews Kevin Patel about his paper (with Pushpak Bhattacharyya) [Towards Lower Bounds on Number of Dimensions for Word Embeddings](http://aclweb.org/anthology/I17-2006).  In this research, the explore an important question of how many hidden nodes to use when creating a word embedding.
