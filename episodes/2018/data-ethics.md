## Data Ethics

This week, Kyle interviews Scott Nestler on the topic of Data Ethics.

Today, no ubiquitous, formal ethical protocol exists for data science, although some have been proposed.  One example is the [INFORMS Ethics Guidelines](https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/Governance/INFORMS-Ethics-Guidelines).

Guidelines like this are rather informal compared to other professions, like the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath).  Yet not every profession requires such a formal commitment.  Guidelines like those proposed by INFORMS might perhaps become a defacto standard, or even an official one.

In this episode, Scott shares his perspective on a variety of ethical questions specific to data and analytics.  While many ethical questions (of the do-no-harm variety) may have obvious answers, the sheer novelty of many data science problems makes discussion of ethics a dynamic one.
