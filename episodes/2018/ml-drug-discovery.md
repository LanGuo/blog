## Drug Discovery with Machine Learning

In today's episode, Kyle chats with Alexander Zhebrak, CTO of Insilico Medicine, Inc.

Insilico self describes as artificial intelligence for drug discovery, biomarker development and aging research.

The conversation in this episode explores the ways in which machine learning, in particular deep learning, is contributing to the advancement of drug discovery.  This happens not just through research but also through software development.  Insilico works on data pipelines and tools like [MOSES](https://medium.com/syncedreview/insilico-medicine-announces-moses-benchmark-platform-for-molecular-generation-5095360ef046), a benchmarking platform to support research on machine learning for drug discovery. The MOSES platform provides a standardized benchmarking dataset, a set of open-sourced models with unified implementation, and metrics to evaluate and assess their performance.
