## Data Skeptic Internship

As was recently announced on the Data Skeptic podcast, we're looking for an intern to work on our next season.  This is a paid role that straddles the analytical side of Data Skeptic and also includes on-air contributions.

The ideal candidate should have some broadcast, performance, or public speaking experience.

During this internship opportunity, you will work on a pre-beta data product.  This will be a hands-on, coding and analytics role.  Part of the role involves writing up components of that work for the our blog and participating in recorded segments for the podcast.

Applicants need to be living in or near <b>Los Angeles, CA</b>, as the internship will require on-site work.

An ideal candidate would have experience with:

* Python or R programming
* Jupyter notebooks
* Machine learning
* RESTful APIs
* Microservices
* SQL
* Statistics

If interested, please send the following items to <a href="mailto:interns@dataskeptic.com">interns@dataskeptic.com</a>

* Resume (PDF)

* Cover letter (PDF)

We are accepting submissions until the end of September, 2018.
