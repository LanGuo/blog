## Cornbread and Overdispersion

For our 50th episode we enduldge a bit by cooking Linhda's previously mentioned "healthy" cornbread.  This leads to a discussion of the statistical topic of overdispersion in which the variance of some distribution is larger than what one's underlying model will account for.

### Linhda's Healthy Cornbread Recipe<

* 1 cup whole grain corn flour
* $\frac{3}{4}$ cups whole wheat flour
* 1 cup white flour
* $\frac{1}{3}$ cup vegetable oil
