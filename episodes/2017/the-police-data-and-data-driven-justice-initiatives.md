## The Police Data Initiative and the Data Driven Justice Initiative

In this episode I speak with Clarence Wardell and Kelly Jin about their mutual service as part of the White House's Police Data Initiative and Data Driven Justice Iniiative respectively.

The [Police Data Initiative](https://publicsafetydataportal.org/) was organized to use open data to increase transparency and community trust as well as to help police agencies use data for internal accountability.  The PDI emerged from recommendations made by the [Task Force on 21st Century Policing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/04/09/using-technology-and-data-improve-community-policing-police-data-initiative).

The [Data Driven Justice Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/datadrivenjustice) was organized to help city, county, and state governments use data-driven strategies to help low-level offenders with mental illness get directed to the right services rather than into the criminal justice system.
