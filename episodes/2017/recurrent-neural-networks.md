## Recurrent Neural Networks

Thanks to our sponsor [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/dataskeptics) - a math and science learning platform that's fun to use.

RNNs are a class of deep learning models designed to capture sequential behavior.  An RNN trains a set of weights which depend not just on new input but also on the previous state of the neural network.  This directed cycle allows the training phase to find solutions which rely on the state at a previous time, thus giving the network a form of memory.  RNNs have been used effectively in language analysis, translation, speech recognition, and many other tasks.
