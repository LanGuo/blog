# Journal Club, episode 11

George talks about [OpenAI's Microscope](https://openai.com/blog/microscope/), a collection of visualisations of the neurons and layers in 6 famous vision models. This library hopes to make analysis of these models a community effort.

Lan talks about [Exploring chemical space with AI](https://cen.acs.org/physical-chemistry/computational-chemistry/Exploring-chemical-space-AI-take/98/i13) and how that may change pharmaceutical drug discovery and development.

Kyle leads a discussion about the paper [Extending Adversarial Attacks to Produce Adversarial Class Probability Distributions
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06383) which shows another control that an adversarial attacker can put in place to better fool machine learning models.
