## Automated Fact Checking

Fake news can be responded to with fact-checking.  However, it's easier to create fake news than the fact check it.

[Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/) is the UK's independent fact-checking organization.  In this episode, Kyle interviews [Mevan Babakar](https://mevanbabakar.com/), head of automated fact checking at Full Fact.

Our discussion talks about the process and challenges of doing fact-checking.  Full Fact has been exploring ways in which machine learning can assist in automating parts of the fact-checking process.  Progress in areas like this allows journalists to be more effective and rapid in responding to new information.  During our discussion, Mevan talks about the steps involved in any fact checking process, which have the potential for automation, and which do not.  Full Fact has been using machine learning in these efforts and we talk about the models they've built.
