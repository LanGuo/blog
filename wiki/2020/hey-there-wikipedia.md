## Hey There Wikipedia!

On numerous occasions in my life, I've boldly informed people of the existence of the Wikipedia `recentchanges` API and insisted they consider using it in some way for whatever there project was.

The ability to see the metadata of history changing in real time must be something that is of great interest to a great number of field.  How cool is it that this data stream exists!  Why am I not looking at it more often?

This post is a trailhead for my meanderings into the `recentchanges` of Wikipedia.
