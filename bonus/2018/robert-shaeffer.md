## Robert Sheaffer

In this episode, Kyle interviews skeptical author [Robert Sheaffer](http://www.sheaffer.org/) on the topic of UFOs.

Robert shares his research into the history of this subject, the cultural implications, and a few noteworthy events and personalities in the UFO folklore.

Our discussion explores the way in which cultural perceptions of UFOlogy have evolved through history.  In days when it might have seemed plausible to some that there was life on Venus, people claimed to meet Venusians.  These differences have changes not just through time, but across culture, as wel discuss.  Kyle also asks Robert for details on the contemporary topic of the "To the Stars Academy".
