## 2015 Holiday Special

Today's episode is a reading of Isaac Asimov's  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Isaac-Asimov-Complete-Stories-Vol/dp/038541627X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1449253483&sr=8-5&keywords=asimov">The Machine that Won the War</a>. I can't think of a story that's more appropriate for Data Skeptic.
