## Practicing and Communicating Data Science with Jeff Stanton

[Jeff Stanton](http://jsresearch.net/) joins me in this episode to discuss his book 
[An Introduction to Data Science](http://101.datascience.community/tag/jeffrey-m-stanton/),
and some of the unique challenges and issues faced by someone doing applied data science. 
A challenge to any data scientist is making sure they have a good input data set and apply any
necessary data munging steps before their analysis.  We cover some good advise for how
to approach such problems.

Jeff's book is an accessible, free download that listeners can enjoy independently, or, while 
participating in the linked 
[Data Science MOOC](http://ischool.syr.edu/newsroom/news.aspx?recid=1532).
We talk a bit about the course as well as the growing 
[iSchools](http://ischools.org/) movement.

Jeff teaches at Syracuse University which offers a 
[Certificate of Advanced Studies in Data Science](http://ischool.syr.edu/future/cas/datascience.aspx)
and a [Doctorate of Applied Studies](http://ischool.syr.edu/future/doctoral/dps.aspx).

During our conversation, Jeff recommended Gerd Gigerenzer's 
[Calculated Risks](http://www.amazon.com/Calculated-Risks-Know-Numbers-Deceive/dp/0743254236) 
as a good read that listeners may enjoy.

For his benevolent reference, Jeff recommends the the R 
[BEST package](http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/) which stands for "Bayesian 
Estimation Supersedes the T-Test".  If you listened to our recent mini-episode on the 
[t-test](http://dataskeptic.com/epnotes/t-test.php), exploring this package 
would be a great next step in learning how to tackle problems of significance testing.
