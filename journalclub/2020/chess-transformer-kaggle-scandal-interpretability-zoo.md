# Journal Club: Episode 1

Welcome to a brand new show from Data Skeptic entitled "Journal Club".

Each episode will feature a regular panel and one revolving guest seat.  The group will discuss a few topics related to data science and focus on one featured scholarly paper which is discussed in detail.

Lan telled the [story](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/) of a transformer learning to play chess. The experiment was to fine-tuned a GPT-2 transformer model using a 2.4M corpus of chess games in standard notation, then to see if it can 'play chess' by generating the next move. This was a thought-provoking way to take adventage of the advances in NLP by 'transforming' a game into the 'language' of written text. This was work done by [Shawn Presser](https://twitter.com/theshawwn?lang=en).

George gave a breakdown of a [Kaggle Cheating Scandal](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/discussion/125436) where a Grandmaster was caught training on the test set. The story follows [Benjamin Minixhofer](https://twitter.com/bminixhofer?lang=en) and his capable detective work to discover an obfuscation that artificially improved the winning team's accuracy.

Kyle lead a discussion on the paper [Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08608) from Finale Doshi-Velez and Been Kim.  The paper is a great survey of the spectrum of interpretability techniques and also contains suggestions for how we describe the "taxonomy" of various methodologies.
