## MS Connect Conference

Cloud services are now ubiquitous in data science and more broading in technology as well.  This week, I speak to [Mark Souza](https://twitter.com/mark_azurecat), [Tobias Ternstr√∂m](https://twitter.com/tobiassql), and [Corey Sanders](https://twitter.com/coreysanderswa) about various aspects of data at scale.  We discuss the embedding of R into SQLServer, SQLServer on linux, open source, and a few other cloud topics.
