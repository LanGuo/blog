## Escaping the Rabbit Hole

Kyle interviews Mick West, author of [Escaping the Rabbit Hole: How to Debunk Conspiracy Theories Using Facts, Logic, and Respect](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1510735801/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0) about the nature of conspiracy theories, the people that believe them, and how to help people escape the belief in false information.

Mick is also the creator of [metabunk.org](https://www.metabunk.org/).

The discussion explores conspiracies like chemtrails, 9/11 conspiracy theories, JFK assassination theories, and the flat Earth theory.  We live in a complex world in which no person can have a sufficient understanding of all topics.  It's only natural that some percentage of people will eventually adopt fringe beliefs.  In this book, Mick provides a fantastic guide to helping individuals who have fallen into a rabbit hole of pseudo-science or fake news.
