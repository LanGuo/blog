## ELMo

[ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo) (Embeddings from Language Models) introduced the idea of deep contextualized word representations.  It extends previous ideas like word2vec and GloVe.  The ELMo model is a neural network able to map natural language into a vector space.  This vector space, out of box, proved to be incredibly useful in a wide variety of seemingly unrelated NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and name entity recognition.
