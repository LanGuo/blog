People define fake news in very different ways, and they also tend to believe that they know so much more than they really do. According our guest, Steven Sloman, there's a sense in which fake news is like pornography, meaning, you know it when you see it. While most of us believe that we have direct access to reality and some things are true, and other things are clearly false, Steven doesnâ€™t.
