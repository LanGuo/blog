## The Bootstrap

The Bootstrap is a method of resampling a dataset to possibly refine it's accuracy and produce useful metrics on the result.  The bootstrap is a useful statistical technique and is leveraged in Bagging (bootstrap aggregation) algorithms such as Random Forest.  We discuss this technique related to polling and surveys.
