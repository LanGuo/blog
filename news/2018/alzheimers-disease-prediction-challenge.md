## Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Challenge

The human brain is the most complicated organ in the human body, and we barely understand it. Recently, scientists are turning to machines to figure out the brain. The hope is if we can decipher the intensely intricate patterns of the brain, we can figure out how to fix it when it’s suffering from a disease.

The primary tool scientists use to peer into and analyze the function of the brain, and its anatomy is [functional magnetic resonance imaging](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7533739/?reload=true), or fMRI, which has only been around since the 1990s. fMRI images show [changes in blood oxygen level](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/05/16/new-evidence-that-fmri-experiments-are-valid-measure-of-neuron-activity/)--a proxy for degree of mental activity--in the scanned human brain. Unfortunately, traditional fMRI gives us just a small view of what’s going on inside the brain. An fMRI doesn't actually provide detail at the level of a cell. Rather, the 3D-image provided by fMRI are made up of units called ‘[voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel).’ These voxels are usually lower than a millimeter cubed, and each one represents a tidy cube of brain tissue. A voxel can represent hundreds of thousands or so brain cells.

A traditional fMRI image can show where broad areas crucial to a behavior exist— for example, one can see where we process negative emotions or those regions that light up when we look at a familiar face. However, the [fMRI doesn’t tell what role those areas play in the behavior](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2013/04/18/fmri-more-voxels-more-problems/) or whether other, less active regions play crucial functions as well. The brain is a mesh of activity— many areas of the brain are quite complex and [involved in multiple processes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-phrenology).

With enough understanding of how the networks of the brain work with one another, scientists and clinicians believe it might be possible to design more and more sophisticated interventions to fix parts of the brain when they get diseased. Interventions to address patients with Alzheimer’s disease are, particularly in need. For those who are not too familiar with Alzheimer’s, it is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder and multifaceted disease that slowly destroys brain cells, resulting in memory loss and cognitive decline, and ultimately dementia. As the condition continues to progress, patients may eventually lose the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. 

Unfortunately, doctors still don’t know precisely when a patient might develop Alzheimer’s Disease, partly due to our limited understanding of the disease itself. Diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease requires careful medical assessment, including patient history, a mini-mental state examination, and physical and neurobiological exams. One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease doctors that doctors look for is the shrinkage of the brain's cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as well as the enlargement of ventricles in the brain.  In addition to these measurements, structural MRI and resting-state fMRI images are taken to study the structure of the brain, functional brain activity, and changes in the organ. 

The severity of symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's is [dependent upon the stage of disease progression](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease). The advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease can easily be recognized in magnetic resonance (MR) images-- the hippocampus and cerebral cortex are [severely shrunk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331682/), and the ventricles are significantly [enlarged](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331682/). The damages affect regions of the brain related to thinking, remembering (mainly short-term memory), planning and judgment. Hence, knowing if and when a patient will develop the condition is essential and could at least help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease early. Beginning early treatment can help preserve and maintain memory and thinking skills.

But treatment options for Alzheimer’s Disease aren’t perfect either. A significant challenge of treating Alzheimer’s disease is that by the time it is diagnosed, the damages in the brain have already advanced too much to reverse. [Most clinical trials](https://www.statnews.com/2017/11/17/beta-amyloid-alzheimers-drugs/) for Alzheimer’s disease have targeted the accumulation of a particular protein known as amyloid, as the build-up of amyloid plaques is one of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. However, most drug trials targeting amyloid have only [resulted in poor results](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.194); therefore, an effective treatment has not yet been found. 

But prediction could change the game.

If doctors could identify people who are the most likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease in the future, they could figure out ways to prevent the condition. Prediction could also change treatment options. One of the main challenges in designing treatment programs is that [Alzheimer’s affects people in many different ways](https://cead.cumc.columbia.edu/content/what-alzheimers-disease), and figuring out how the disease will progress in each person is a complicated problem. Moreover, some of the signs found in Alzheimer's disease imaging data have [also been identified](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22236691) in imaging data of a healthy aging brain. For these reasons, clinicians have long been interested in developing an assistive tool or algorithm to classify MR-based imaging data and to distinguish brain disorder data from healthy subjects.

Researchers involved in the [Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) are using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to help diagnosis and prediction of the disease, when combined with additional patient data, including psychology, demography, and genetics. The ADNI study involves roughly 1,100 patients who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease to track potential disease-related changes. Partner research teams, such as the [Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at the University of Southern California (LONI)](http://www.loni.usc.edu/), are using machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning, on ADNI's datasets to classify Alzheimer’s disease and aid in the accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer’s patients.

Last year, ADNI teamed up with the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the [European Progression of Neurological Disease (EuroPOND) Consortium](http://europond.eu/) to launch a new international competition called ‘[The Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE)](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/)’ challenge. Using existing data that have been collected during the ADNI study as a standardized dataset, TADPOLE contestants developed models to predict how Alzheimer’s disease could progress over time. These data come from cognitive tests, MRI, positron emission tomography of amyloid and glucose metabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from a range of patients with mild cognitive impairment, mild Alzheimer’s to severe Alzheimer’s disease. The participants’ main goal was to predict who will develop cognitive, clinical, and MRI signs of Alzheimer’s disease in the next five years, or in short enough timeframe to carry out a clinical trial. 

One aspect of the contest is that participants will be compared with their counterparts to determine whose predictive model best showed the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in individual patients during the five-year period. The reason for this is because most models previously developed by various researchers are [rarely compared to each other](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/01/03/alzheimers-and-the-rare-disease-model).

The entrants, which could be anyone from established researchers to citizen scientists and high school and university students, have already submitted their predictive models last November. The results of the challenge won’t be announced until a year or two. During this time, the patients in the ADNI study dataset will continue to be assessed and measured, and any new data will be stored. The follow-up data, once available, will then be used to evaluate the predictive models. The models that give the most accurate prediction of disease progression will win a money prize, which is still to be determined at the moment.

These forecasts could significantly improve the way people with Alzheimer’s disease receive treatment. Once doctors identify the features that can be used to measure Alzheimer’s disease progression, they can prescribe the most suitable drugs for individual people.
