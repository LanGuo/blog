## Recurrent Relational Networks

One of the most challenging NLP tasks is natural language understanding and reasoning.  How can we construct algorithms that are able to achieve human level understanding of text and be able to answer general questions about it?

This is truly an open problem, and one with the [bAbI](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/) dataset has been constructed to facilitate.  bAbI presents a variety of different language understanding and reasoning tasks and exists as benchmark for comparing approaches.

In this episode, Kyle talks to [Rasmus Berg Palm](https://twitter.com/rasmusbergpalm) about his recent paper [Recurrent Relational Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7597-recurrent-relational-networks.pdf)
