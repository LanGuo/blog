Kyle: European Commision White Paper

Lan talks about her idea for a blog post. Continueing her experimentation with fine-tuing GPT2 with Seinfeld scripts, she adapts the work from the [Dark Secret of BERT](https://text-machine-lab.github.io/blog/2020/bert-secrets/) paper to visualize attention weights in the fine-tuned GPT2.  

George presents [A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf). A seminal paper both that coins the family of "Additive Feature Attribution Methods", unifying many existing techniques, and puts forth its own, ["SHAP"](https://github.com/slundberg/shap). This game theoretic approach combines previous interpretability works with an estimation of Shapley Values.
