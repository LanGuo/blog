## Algorithmic Detection of Fake News

The scale and frequency with which information can be distributed on social media makes the problem of fake news a rapidly metastasizing issue.  To do any content filtering or labeling demands an algorithmic solution.

In today's episode, Kyle interviews Kai Shu and Mike Tamir about their independent work exploring the use of machine learning to detect fake news.

Kai Shu and his co-authors published [Fake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01967), a research paper which both surveys the existing literature and organizes the structure of the problem in a robust way.

Mike Tamir led the development of [fakerfact.org](https://www.fakerfact.org/login), a website and Chrome/Firefox plugin which leverages machine learning to try and predict the category of a previously unseen web page, with categories like opinion, wiki, and fake news.
