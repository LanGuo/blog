## Partially Observable State Spaces

When dealing with dynamic systems that are potentially undergoing constant change, its helpful to describe what "state" they are in. In many applications the manner in which the state changes from one to another is not completely predictable, thus, there is uncertainty over how it transitions from state to state. Further, in many applications, one cannot directly observe the true state, and thus we describe such situations as partially observable state spaces. This episode explores what this means and why it is important in the context of chess, poker, and the mood of Yoshi the lilac crowned amazon parrot.
