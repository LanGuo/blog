## Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

An ROC curve is a plot that compares the trade off of true positives and false positives of a binary classifier under different thresholds.  The area under the curve (AUC) is useful in determining how discriminating a model is.  Together, ROC and AUC are very useful diagnostics for understanding the power of one's model and how to tune it.
