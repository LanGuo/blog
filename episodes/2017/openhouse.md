## OpenHouse

No reliable, complete database cataloging home sales data at a transaction level is available for the average person to access.  To a data scientist interesting in studying this data, our hands are complete tied.  Opportunities like testing sociological theories, exploring economic impacts, study market forces, or simply research the value of an investment when buying a home are all blocked by the lack of easy access to this dataset.  OpenHouse seeks to correct that by centralizing and standardizing all publicly available home sales transactional data.  In this episode, we discuss the achievements of OpenHouse to date, and what plans exist for the future.
