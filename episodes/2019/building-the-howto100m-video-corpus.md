## Building the howto100m Video Corpus 

 Video annotation is an expensive and time-consuming process. As a consequence, the available video datasets are useful but small. The availability of machine transcribed explainer videos offers a unique opportunity to rapidly develop a useful, if dirty, corpus of videos that are "self annotating", as hosts explain the actions they are taking on the screen.

 This episode is a discussion of the <a href= "https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/howto100m/">HowTo100m</a> dataset - a project which has assembled a video corpus of 136M video clips with captions covering 23k activities.
