## Max Pooling

Max-pooling is a procedure in a neural network which has several benefits.  It performs dimensionality reduction by taking a collection of neurons and reducing them to a single value for future layers to receive as input.  It can also prevent overfitting, since it takes a large set of inputs and admits only one value, making it harder to memorize the input.  In this episode, we discuss the intuitive interpretation of max-pooling and why it's more common than mean-pooling or (theoretically) quartile-pooling.
