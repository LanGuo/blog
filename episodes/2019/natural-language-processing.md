## Let's Talk About Natural Language Processing

This episode reboots our podcast with the theme of Natural Language Processing for the next few months.

We begin with introductions of Yoshi and Linh Da and then get into a broad discussion about natural language processing: what it is, what some of the classic problems are, and just a bit on approaches.

Finishing out the show is an interview with Lucy Park about her work on the KoNLPy library for Korean NLP in Python.

If you want to share your NLP project, please join our Slack channel.  We're eager to see what listeners are working on!
