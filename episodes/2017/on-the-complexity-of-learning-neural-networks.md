## On the Complexity of Learning Neural Networks

John Wilmes is a postdoctoral researcher in the Algorithms and Randomness Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2016 from the University of Chicago, where he worked under the supervision of László Babai ba bai as a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. John's research interests lie in discrete math and the theory of computing.
