## EXP-Time

In this episode we discuss the complexity class of EXP-Time which contains algorithms which require $O(2^{p(n)})$ time to run.  In other words, the worst case runtime is exponential in some polynomial of the input size.  Problems in this class are even more difficult than problems in $NP$ since you can't even verify a solution in polynomial time.

We mostly discuss Generalized Chess as an intuitive example of a problem in EXP-Time.  Another well known problem is determining if a given algorithm will halt in $k$ steps.  That extra condition of restricting it to $k$ steps makes this problem distinct from Turing's original definition of the halting problem which is known to be intractable.

If you enjoy this episode, learning the [time hierarchy theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_hierarchy_theorem) is a good next step.
