## Studying Competition and Gender Through Chess

Prior work has shown that people's response to competition is in part predicted by their gender.  Understanding why and when this occurs is important in areas such as labor market outcomes.  A well structured study is challenging due to numerous confounding factors.  Peter Backus and his colleagues have identified competitive chess as an ideal arena to study the topic.  Find out why and what conclusions they reached.

Our discussion centers around [Gender, Competition and Performance: Evidence from Real Tournaments](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2858984) from Backus, Cubel, Guid, Sanchez-Pages, and Ma√±as.  A summary of their paper can also be found [here](http://voxeu.org/article/women-competitive-environments-evidence-expert-chess).
