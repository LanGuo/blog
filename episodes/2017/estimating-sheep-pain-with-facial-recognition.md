# Estimating Sheep Pain with Facial Recognition

Marwa Mahmoud received her Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, England in 2014. She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Graphics and Interaction Group at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, where she studies emotional inference from gestures and expressions. Marwa's research interests lie in the field of affective computing, social signal processing, and automating machine understanding of Emotional Body Language. Aspects of her research draw on computer vision, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and psychology. Marwa holds a B.S. and an M.S. in Computer Science from the American University in Cairo, Egypt.

## Interview questions

My research interests lie in the field of automating machine understanding of Emotional Body Language, , which includes expressions of emotions or medical conditions. My research draws on computer vision, machine learning, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and psychology, which makes it very exciting in its interdisciplinary aspects. 

How much communication is non-verbal?

Text to speech and other breakthroughs in HCI get big press, deservedly.  We hear about Kinect which is crude, not natural.  But not so much for gesture recognition.  Why is that?

The Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES)

What is the accuracy of human scorers? [60 to 75%]

How do you know ground truth?

What industries concern themselves with Sheep Pain?

In facial recognition, there are great image corpuses we can use.  What do you have for sheep?

What pre-processing do you do on those images?  [Featurewise Normalisation]

What sort of feature engineering do you do? [Facial action units, Histogram of oriented gradients, PCA]

What is your objective function for training?

What algorithm did you use?  Why? [SVM]

With a limited set of examples, how do you decide the right training, test, and validation sets to use?

What sort of accuracy did you see?

What is keeping that from being higher?

How easily will your methods transfer to other animals?

Why not deep learning?

Do you think transfer learning could be useful for you?

What are some opportunities for future applications of your work?

Have animal rights activists responded to your work in any way?
