George shows off the [Giant Language Test Room](http://gltr.io/), a web based tool for detecting whether a sample text was generated by BERT or GPT-2. The nifty interface demonstrates that a weakness of these large language models is their predictability.

Lan presents a news item about [Setting Fairness Goals with TensorFlow Constrained Optimization Library](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/setting-fairness-goals-with-tensorflow.html). This library lets users configure and train machine learning problems based on multiple different metrics, making it easy to formulate and solve many problems of interest to the fairness community.
