## Automated Fact Checking

Fake news can be responded to with fact-checking.  However, it's easier to create fake news than the fact check it.

[Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/) is the UK's independent fact-checking organization.  In this episode, Kyle interviews [Mevan Babakar](https://mevanbabakar.com/), head of automated fact checking at Full Fact.

Our discussion talks about the process and challenges of doing fact-checking.  Full Fact has been exploring ways in which machine learning can assist in automating parts of the fact-checking process.  Progress in areas like this allows journalists to be more effective and rapid in responding to new information.
