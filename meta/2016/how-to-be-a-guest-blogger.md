## How to be a Guest Blogger on dataskeptic.com

When we relaunched dataskeptic.com and I started blogging more regularly, I hadn't predicted the influx in traffic to the site that would result almost immediately.  I'm doing my best to post useful content regularly, but that's a hard pace to keep.

I am eager to expand on the voices found on this blog.  I'm going to invite certain people to make contributions from time to time, but I'm also open to solicitations for people looking to do a guest blog post.  It will have to meet our editorial guidelines, but we're happy to work together with contributors to make that happen.  Doing a guest blog post here is a great way to get instant exposure for your message.  It also can be a nice place to showcase your work, and an attention getting bullet on your resume.

If you are interested in doing a guest post, first read this post in its entirety.  Second, reach out to kyle@dataskeptic.com and share your idea, before you begin writing it.  We'd like to make sure everyone is one the same page before you expend a lot of energy.

Guest posts must always meet the following criteria:

1. Be the author's own original work
2. Not be posted elsewhere on the web, nor have the intention of posting it elsewhere for one year after it first appears on dataskeptic.com
3. Be generally well written and in the tone seen on the dataskeptic.com blog
4. Relate in some way to an episode of the show or a topic in the data world

A general set of guidelines you might want to follow include:

* Have a well crafted data visualization that elegantly tells your message
* Bias towards brevity
* Have a firm conclusion
* Include some formal analysis
* Point out the strengths and weaknesses of any analysis you do

We publish in three formats: markdown, Jupyter notebooks, and knitr's Rmd format.

We look forward to helping you share your thoughts with the world.
