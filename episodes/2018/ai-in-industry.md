## AI in Industry

This episode recaps some of the AI news from Microsoft's 2018 Build developers conference. There's so much to discuss on the AI side, it's hard to know where to begin. Luckily,  Steve Guggenheimer, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI Business, and Carlos Pessoa, a software engineering manager for the company’s Cloud AI Platform, talked to Kyle about announcements related to AI in industry.

In the first half, Kyle's interview with Steve discusses how Microsoft currently approaches AI from a business perspective and how other businesses can integrate and leverage AI. Steve talks about how Microsoft's focus on building a new set of AI services and tools to make AI accessible to every organization out there, which involves infusing AI into Microsoft's core products.

In the second half, Kyle and Carlos discuss the cognitive services that are a part of Microsoft's AI Platform, particularly the Intelligent Kiosk, which is a collection of demos showcasing workflows and experiences built on top of the Microsoft Cognitive Services. Most of its demos are hands-free and autonomous, using the human faces in front of a web camera as the main form of input. Carlos also talks about how his team built a skin cancer prediction app with Azure Machine Learning, CoreML & Xamarin.
