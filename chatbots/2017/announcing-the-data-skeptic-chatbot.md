## Announcing the Data Skeptic Chatbot

Today we're launching a chatbot for our site.  Rather than start from one of the many excellent tools out there to build a quick, effective bot out of box, we're starting from scratch.

The bot is going to be a long term work in progress, and we're going to document it's development on the blog.

We haven't named it yet, and your conversations will be largely underwhelming to begin with.  But check back often, as we're going to make incremental improvements with time.
