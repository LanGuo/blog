## Stealing Machine Learning Models from Cloud APIs

Platform as a service is a growing trend in data science where services like fraud analysis and face detection can be provided via APIs.  Such services turn the actual model into a black box to the consumer.  But can the model be reverse engineered?

<a href="http://floriantramer.com/">Florian Tram&egrave;r</a> shares his work in this episode showing that it can.  The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02943">Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction APIs</a> is definitely worth your time to read if you enjoy this episode.
