[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) joins us help answer the question [why do neural networks think a panda is a vulture](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/why-do-neural-networks-think-a-panda-is-a-vulture).  Kyle talks to Julia about her hands-on work fooling neural networks.

Julia runs [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/) which publishes works such as [Your Linux Toolbox](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Linux-Toolbox-Julia-Evans/dp/1593279779).  You can find her on Twitter [@b0rk](https://twitter.com/b0rk)
