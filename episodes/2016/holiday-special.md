## 2016 Holiday Special


Today's episode is a reading of Isaac Asimov's [Fanchise](http://www.amazon.com/Isaac-Asimov-Complete-Stories-Vol/dp/038541627X/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1449253483&sr=8-5&keywords=asimov).  As mentioned on the show, this is just a work of fiction to be enjoyed and not in any way some obfuscated political statement.  Enjoy, and happy holidays!
