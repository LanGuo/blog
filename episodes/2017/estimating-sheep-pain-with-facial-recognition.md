http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pr10/publications/fg17.pdf

## Interview questions

The Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES)

What is the accuracy of human scorers? [60 to 75%]

How do you know ground truth?

What industries concern themselves with Sheep Pain?

In facial recognition, there are great image corpuses we can use.  What do you have for sheep?

What pre-processing do you do on those images?  [Featurewise Normalisation]

What sort of feature engineering do you do? [Facial action units, Histogram of oriented gradients, PCA]

What is your objective function for training?

What algorithm did you use?  Why? [SVM]

With a limited set of examples, how do you decide the right training, test, and validation sets to use?

What sort of accuracy did you see?

What is keeping that from being higher?

How easily will your methods transfer to other animals?

Why not deep learning?

Do you think transfer learning could be useful for you?

What are some opportunities for future applications of your work?

Have animal rights activists responded to your work in any way?
