## A Skeptic's Perspective on AI

Last summer, I had the privilege of presenting for the 5th annual [SkeptiCal Con](http://www.skepticalcon.com/).  They've just announced Sunday, June 6th as the date for the 2019 conference and I look forward to being an attendee.

My talk just went live on Youtube.  Check it out!
