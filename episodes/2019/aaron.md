active learning

I) solving a problem in an enterprise setting

no labels - how to approach?
	rule based like NER based on capital letters
	metalearners to trust or distrust rules (stacking)
approaches to getting labels

II) webpage classification by url
	they find patterns and present as a graph
	labeller is asked to describe pattern
	why not regular expressions? 

III) location resolution - resolve string to database of known locations

lessons learned
	picking examples that are easy
	need to use examples annotated to score new
	prioritizing labels that are important to the business
	technical risk relying too much on deep learning model

IV) successful embedding design
	they are doing stuff here
	sense2vec from spacy team
		they add features related to position of a token
	URL embeddings



has messy taxonomy
want to bring certain things for human annotators
