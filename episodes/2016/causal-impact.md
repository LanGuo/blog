## Causal Impact

Today's episode is all about Causal Impact, a technique for estimating the impact of a particular event on a time series.  We talk to [William Martin](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Martin/) about his research into the impact releases have on app and we also chat with [Karen Blakemore](https://twitter.com/kjblakemore) about a project she helped us build to explore the impact of a Saturday Night Live appearance on a musician's career.

Martin's work culminated in a paper [Causal Impact for App Store Analysis](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Martin/pubs/Martin_FSE_Causal_PrePrint.pdf).  A shorter summary version can be found [here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Martin/pubs/Martin_ACM_SRC_cameraReady.pdf).  His company helping app developers do this sort of analysis can be found at [crestweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/appredict/](http://crestweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/appredict/).
