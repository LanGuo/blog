Language


## Thesis

Default perspective on AI
Scott & quantum parallel - engineering or new physics
The four force of nature made us possible, what prohibits AGI?
What don't we know?
	dnns are old idea
	bajillion jillion
	GANs
Puppet or person? puppet = static
Not about consciousness
Turing Test is best
Everybody gets the setup, not everybody gets the punchline
Natural language as a programming language
"Go work on the reimann hypothesis"



Linhda and I have a pet bird.  She's a lilac crowned amazon named Yoshi.  I wanted to call the bird Brian Fellows but Linhda thought people wouldn't get the reference.  Yoshi's mostly green and literally a dinosaur, so I guess in the end this was a better name anyway.

We think Yoshi is very smart.  She's able to mimic our voices and repeat certain phrases.  Most of this is mimicry.  I don't really believe she means it when she says "I love you" but its still awfully cute.  We taught her to say that through repetition and reward.  

What does this have to do with artificial intelligence?



It was reinforcement learning in the trustiest sense.

Yoshi knows some phrases that we didn't teach her.  At least not on purpose.  The most interesting one is when she says "go on".  This is a phrase that, in retrospect, I realized I was saying whenever I wanted her to jump on or off my hand.  This intelligent little creature associated those sounds with human based transportation.  After we noticed it, we started encouraging and reinforcing this prhase.  When the bird says "go on", she gets picked up.  Very quickly, she took to using this phrase not only when she wanted you to move her but also when she was ready to go to bed at night and wanted to be taken to her bedroom, away from the noisy primates in the common areas of the house.

So what does any of this have to do with artificial intelligence?

Having a strong opinion about artificial intelligence is like saying you're *certain* intelligent extra terrestrial life exists somewhere in the universe.  I mean, that does seem likely, but there's simply no rational reason why any person today should say they are certain.  The collective knowledge of humanity is insufficient to establish certainty on this topic.  If you're interested in this topic, we can debate the parameters of the Drake Equation.  We can have handy wavvy discussions about the fermet paradox.  I'm sure there's room for a reasonable statistical arguement about all the right materials for life being on a planet inside a goldylox zone and then computing the probability that the dynamics of that system would evolve into a state that produces intelligent life given enough time.

But this is the very definition of a hand wavvy arguement.

If we can't even define things well, how can we have a discussion about them?

So let's get to it, what's the definition of artificial intelligence?

## What the heck does artificial intelligence?

Pete Nelson's story
my memory
peter's work was all about predicting traffic using neural nets
you can imagine a lot of diagnostic plots, some slides about solinoids
and why not throw in one slide about what is AI?
John McCarthy stops him, as John McCarthy should be privledged to do, and takes this lecture on a 45 minute detour into a philosophical discussion of this question

So, what the heck does artificial intelligence mean?

Before we define it, you know, if you ask me, the phrase is bankrupt.

The marketing departments of many corporations would have you believe things as simple as keyword matching are artificially intelligence.  When it comes to claims like that, We're going to put a bit more of the skeptic in data skeptic in 2018.  Of course, that isn't to say every claim related to AI is propaganda or alarmism.  We can draw a few fair comparisons between artificial intelligence and nuclear power.  Both required the brightest human minds to develop.  Both will demand long page counts in the history books of the future.  Both have the potential to do tremendous good and tremendous harm, although we should be more specific about exactly what harm is plausible from AI.  AI, if brought to maturity and scale, stands to revolutionize human society even more than nuclear power.

Oh, and by the way, maybe some of you have noticed that I've been dodging the question for several minutes now.  What the heck does artificial intelligence mean?

We'll get to that.  It's a brand new year.  My resolution is to speak my mind a little bit more often.

There's a lot of Fake AI.  A lot of demonstrably false headlines.  A lot of confusion and misinterpretation over legitimate things.  We're going to try and be a source of good scientific skepticism for these topics going forward.  We'll share a skeptical perspective on the sensational and also comment on good progress.

But I'm not going to fight with companies about whether or not their products can be called AI.

In truth, it's kind of been a moving goal post for a while.

Used to say what computers could not do.  Chess, Checkers, Jeapordy, Go.

There is one challenge that hasn't been past.

The Turing Test.

Turing didn't say Chess or Go, despite knowing them.  He went right to language.  Why?

We'll have an episode on the Turing Test.  Stay tuned.

Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".[2]

Before we define artificial intelligence, let's take a step back and ask if its the right question.
Wrong question - what does the sun taste like.

Maybe we can compare it in contrast to human intelligence?



Artificial general intelligence is the ability to do anything the human brain can do only done by a digital computer.

So then what is human intelligence?

Baby vs adult.
No kids but
Remember nephew flailing arms
Trying to figure out motor skills
Dont know anything yet
Now he's sending me screenshots of minecraft builds
A lot smarter
Maybe we'd even say bright for his grade
But he doesn't know maxwell equations yet
He doesn't have the math necessary to use them
Maybe he'll learn one day
But if he doesn't still intelligent
Intelligence doesn't mean educated
Intelligence is issolated to certain tasks.
You can be the worlds most brilliant cryptographer and still put your clothes on backwards
But if we think of humans as a whole, we're all specialists
We're all the same technology, if you'll pardon my use of the word in that way
AGI must be defined similarly.  Broadly intelligent with the ability to adapt and specialize

We're going to mix up conscious / self-aware and intelligence.

We'll talk about both, but we'll focus on intelligent.

Can we make a computer display intelligence?  Can it learn and adapt to new situations?  Can it solve abstract problems like planning and coordinating a wedding?

It's hard to find a definition that doesn't admit some wierd corner case like a definition that considers a modern airplane to be intelligent.

We're sticking with the turing test, and you'll hear more about why.

But basically, language is amongst the hardest things.  Requires abstraction of ideas and integration of unbounded new information.

Is that going to be possible?  Can we prove it one way or the other?

How far away are we?

Those are just some of the questions we'll explore this year on Data Skeptic.

Please point people to the show who might be interested in this topic.  If you have something to say, let's do it on slack.  If you see claims about AI, please let us know



Next week is the jumping on point
