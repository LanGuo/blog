## Detecting Fast Radio Bursts with Deep Learning

Fast radio bursts are an astrophysical phenomenon first observed in 2007.  While many observations have been made, science has yet to explain the mechanism for these events.  This has led some to ask: could it be a form of extra-terrestrial communication?

Probably not.  Kyle asks Gerry Zhang who works at the [Berkeley SETI Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu/) about this possibility and more importantly, about his applications of deep learning to detect fast radio bursts.

Radio astronomy captures observations from space which can be converted to a waterfall chart or spectrogram.  These data structures can be formatted in a visual way and also make great candidates for applying deep learning to the task of detecting the fast radio bursts.
