## Azure Databricks

I sat down with [Ali Ghodsi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/), CEO and founder of Databricks, and [John Chirapurath](https://twitter.com/originaljgc), GM for Data Platform Marketing at Microsoft related to the recent announcement of Azure Databricks.

When I heard about the announcement, my first thoughts were two fold.  First, the possibility of optimized integrations with existing Azure services.  This would be a big benefit to heavy Azure users who also want to use Spark.  Second, the benefits of active directory to control Databricks access for large enterprise.

Hear Ali and JG's thoughts and comments on what makes Azure Databricks a novel offering.
